#TRENDY BOUTIQUE
This is a website for online shoppers. It will contain images of clothes for men and women and the price of same. This should be user friendly, colourful readily available information for shoppers with secure access to pay using Stripe. Users will be able to create their own accounts, so they can have a personalised user experience.
#UX
#User Stories
##First Time Visitor Goals
As a first time user I want to find it easy to navigate the site and the content should be useful and user friendly. It has to be visually appealing so that I will want to return and have a positive opinion of the store. It should be easy to access further information about the different clothes on offer.
##Returning Visitor Goals
As a returning visitor I would like to be able to create an account and be able to securely access my shopping bag. Payments should be secure and quick. I would likely want to readily have access to contact information where my questions can be answered.
##Frequent User Goals
I would want to have ready access to my account. I would likey want access to a saved clothes that I haven’t decided about or cannot afford until month-end etc..  I would also want to be able to see the deals and special offers. I would want to feel that my experience is better than people who are just browsing so I would like to have notifications of say discounts to come, or account holder discounts.
#Design
##Colour Scheme
I used a simple but warm bright colour scheme. I felt that an image of a person with a dog would give it a homely family feel and also hint toward the fact that there are clothes for the dogs as well. I felt this image would make most people feel represented because the clothes are trendy, but comfortable looking.
##Typography
The Lato font is the main font used throughout the whole website because it looks professional and attractive.
#Imagery
Imagery is important, so I kept it bright and appealing. I used the ideas and coding from the Code Institute lessons. I borrowed the ideas and coding from the Code institute lessons which are visually stimulating, together with the recommended use of Fontawesome.
#Wireframes
I used an excel file for the wire frames as I am comfortable and familiar with it and I wanted a vivid clear structure. I have saved it in the wireframe folder as a PDF in the Wireframe folder. I ran out of time to do a proper one, so used what was available from the lesson.
#Features
I followed the structure from Code Institute Fullstack Frameworks with Django Project so I could have a set up guide and structure. I only made minor asthetic changes, mostly media ones due to personal time constraints, that didn’t qualify for an extension.
##Page one
This is the home page, designed to draw the users into the site and products.
##Page two
Products with a drop down menu for streamline selections.
##Page three
Clothing with a drop down menu for streamline selections.

##Page three
Special Offers with a dropdown menu to streamline selections.
#Existing Features

##Features Left to Implement
I have left room for further images to be added.

#Testing
•	Frame8 in gitpod
#Deployment
I started out by creating a Git pod project on Git hub. Set up a new README.md file and used the structure from Code Institute as a guide. I copied a lot to avoid error. I created a Wireframe in excel from the E-commerce store user stories, then print screened it and converted it to PDF so I could drad and drop it to the WireFrame folder I creaded in Gitpod. I followed Code Institute lesson format for the structure and coding. I paid close attention to the guidance from the institute and noted the various methods used to remove unattractive gaps.
